# Greg Frazier's Web Development Project

My project is a sample website designed for a writer. It is designed for multiple formats, with a long horizontal navigation bar replaced by a drop-down navigation bar to avoid taking up too much screen space on smaller devices. There are links to where to buy the books on the homepage, a "Books and Short Stories" news page with descriptions of each work, a form (with no back-end as of yet) on which to sign up for an e-mail list, with a personalized verification pop-up. The form is accessible both on its own page and through modals presented on some of the other pages.
