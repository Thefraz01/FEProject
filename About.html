<p>	Welcome too the Lab, the section formerly known as "About". I didn't reallyy have anything planned for this area, (at least not yet), so I decided to use it as (one of) the places I experimented with code before integrating it into the CSS/Javascript for the whole site. Just in case I mmight break something. Amazing how many thiiings worked beautifully here, but then took hours trying to figure out why they didn't work (or made something else worse) after integrating it into the whole project. Well, didn't have much else to do on this page, other than that. And tell you this is where I made that little button up there. (And that if I had a little more time,  it would probably look a little different, and be in a different place. And redundancies like the mailing list link and the "Find Me on Amazon" links would probably be gone as well in favor of things like this modal or other generally cooler ways to do the same thing.)
